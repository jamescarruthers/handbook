The firm stated that they would deal with PEPs but with appropriate care. However, the firm did not have a rigorous system in place to be able to identify PEPs – this was a concern given the nationality and residence of some underlying customers.

Weaknesses related in particular to: many firms’ limited understanding of the applicable legal and regulatory regimes, incomplete or inadequate bribery and corruption risk assessments; lack of senior management oversight; and failure to monitor the effective implementation of, and compliance with, anti-bribery and corruption policies and procedures.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="level guidance" id="D6"><div class="details"><span class="extended" id="D6">FCTR 13.1.4</span><span class="section-type guidance" title="Guidance">G</span><time><span>13/12/2018</span></time></div><div class="section-content"><div class="guidance"><p><a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2018/FCA_2018_54.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2018/54 - 13/12/2018">1</a>The contents of this report are reflected in <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG 6</a></span></span> (Bribery and corruption).</p></div></div></div></section></div>

But, despite our extensive work in this area over recent years, we found significant and widespread weaknesses in most of the sample banks’ AML systems and controls and some banks’ sanctions controls. We also found that AML resources were inadequate in one-third of all banks in our sample and that some overseas banks struggled to reconcile their group AML policies with UK AML standards and requirements.</p>

To this end, our sample included five banks that had also been part of our sample in 2011.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="level guidance" id="D5"><div class="details"><span class="extended" id="D5">FCTR 16.1.3</span><a name="D34"></a><span class="section-type guidance" title="Guidance">G</span><time><span>13/12/2018</span></time></div><div class="section-content"><div class="guidance"><p><a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2018/FCA_2018_54.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2018/54 - 13/12/2018">1</a>A small number of banks in our sample had implemented effective AML and sanctions controls.

This will help them understand which parts of their business are most vulnerable to money laundering and which parts they should prioritise in their fight against financial crime. It will also help banks decide on the appropriate level of CDD and monitoring for individual business relationships.
</p><p><strong>A business-wide risk assessment:</strong>
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D31"><p>•	must be comprehensive, meaning that it should consider a wide range of factors, including the risk associated with the bank’s customers, products, and services – it is not normally enough to consider just one factor</p></li>

<li class="subpara1" id="D33"><p>•	must be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the bank’s activities.</p></li>
</ol><p>Banks should build on their business-wide risk assessment to determine the level of CDD they should apply to individual business relationships or occasional transactions. CDD will help banks refine their assessment of risk associated with individual business relationships or occasional transactions and will determine whether additional CDD measures should be applied and the extent of monitoring that is required to mitigate that risk. An individual assessment of risk associated with a business relationship or occasional transaction can inform, but is no substitute for, a business-wide risk assessment.
</p><p><strong>A customer risk assessment:</strong>
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D34"><p>•	should enable banks to take a holistic view of the risk associated with a business relationship or occasional transaction by considering all relevant risk factors, and</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D35"><p>•	should be recorded – where the risk is high, banks should include the reason why they are content to accept the risk associated with the business relationship or occasional transaction and details of any steps the bank will take to mitigate the risks, such as restrictions on the account or enhanced monitoring.</p></li>

It also helps the bank to manage the increased risk by deepening its understanding of the customer, the beneficial owner, and the nature and purpose of the relationship.
</p><p>The extent of EDD must be commensurate with the risk associated with the business relationship or occasional transaction but banks can decide, in most cases, which aspects of CDD they should enhance.
</p><p>Senior management should be provided with all relevant information (eg, source of wealth, source of funds, potential risks, adverse information and red flags) before approving PEP relationships to ensure they understand the nature of, and the risks posed by, the relationship they are approving.
</p><p>Examples of effective EDD measures we observed included:
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D37"><p>•	obtaining more information about the customer’s or beneficial owner’s business</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D38"><p>•	obtaining more robust verification of the beneficial owner’s identity on the basis of information obtained from a reliable and independent source</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D39"><p>•	carrying out searches on a corporate customer’s directors (or individuals exercising control) to understand whether their business or integrity affects the level of risk associated with the business relationship, for example because they also hold a public function</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D40"><p>•	using open source websites to gain a better understanding of the customer or beneficial owner, their reputation and their role in public life – where banks find information containing allegations of wrongdoing or court judgments, they should assess how this affects the level of risk associated with the business relationship</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D41"><p>•	establishing the source of wealth to be satisfied that this is legitimate – banks can establish the source of wealth through a combination of customer-provided information, open source information and documents such as evidence of title, copies of trust deeds and audited accounts (detailing dividends)</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D42"><p>•	establishing the source of funds used in the business relationship to be satisfied they do not constitute the proceeds of crime</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D43"><p>•	commissioning external third-party intelligence reports where it is not possible for the bank to easily obtain information through open source searches or there are doubts about the reliability of open source information, and</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D44"><p>•	where the bank considers whether to rely on another firm for EDD purposes, it ensures that the extent of EDD measures is commensurate with the risk it has identified and that it holds enough information about the customer to carry out meaningful enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship – the bank must also be satisfied that the quality of EDD is sufficient to satisfy the UK’s legal and regulatory requirements.</p></li>

<li class="subpara1" id="D54"><p>•	transactions unexpectedly involving high-risk jurisdictions, sectors or individuals</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D55"><p>•	early repayment of loans or increased frequency/size of repayments</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D56"><p>•	accounts with low balances but a high volume of large debits and credits</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D57"><p>•	cumulative turnover significantly exceeding the customer’s income/expected activity</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D58"><p>•	debits being made shortly after credits of the same value are received</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D59"><p>•	the customer making frequent transactions just below transaction monitoring alert thresholds</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D60"><p>•	debits to and credits from third parties where there is no obvious explanation for the transaction, and</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D61"><p>•	the customer providing insufficient or misleading information when asked about a transaction, or being otherwise evasive.</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>Customer reviews</strong>
</p><p>Banks must keep the documents, data or information obtained as part of the CDD process up to date. This will help banks ascertain that the level of risk associated with the business relationship has not changed, or enable them to take appropriate steps where it has changed.
</p><p>Examples of factors which banks may consider when conducting periodic reviews.
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D62"><p>•	Has the nature of the business relationship changed?</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D63"><p>•	Does the risk rating remain appropriate in the light of any changes to the business relationship since the last review?</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D64"><p>•	Does the business relationship remain within the firm’s risk appetite?</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D65"><p>•	Does the actual account activity match the expected activity indicated at the start of the relationship? If it does not, what does this mean?</p></li>
</ol><p>Examples of measures banks may take when reviewing business relationships:</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D66"><p>•	assessing the transactions flowing through the customer’s accounts at a business relationship level rather than at an individual transaction level to identify any trends</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D67"><p>•	repeating screening for sanctions, PEPs and adverse media, and</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D68"><p>•	refreshing customer due diligence documentation, in particular where this is not in line with legal and regulatory standards.</p></li>

This sample also included five intermediaries that had been part of the sample in 2010.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="level guidance" id="D5"><div class="details"><span class="extended" id="D5">FCTR 17.1.3</span><span class="section-type guidance" title="Guidance">G</span><time><span>13/12/2018</span></time></div><div class="section-content"><div class="guidance"><p><a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2018/FCA_2018_54.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2018/54 - 13/12/2018">1</a>While most intermediaries had begun to look at their ABC systems and controls, this was work in progress and more improvement was needed. We found that most intermediaries we saw were still not managing their bribery and corruption risk effectively. Business-wide bribery and corruption risk assessments were based on a range of risk factors that were too narrow and many intermediaries failed to take a holistic view of the bribery and corruption risk associated with individual relationships. Half of the due diligence files we reviewed were inadequate and senior management oversight was often weak.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="level guidance" id="D6"><div class="details"><span class="extended" id="D6">FCTR 17.1.4</span><span class="section-type guidance" title="Guidance">G</span><time><span>13/12/2018</span></time></div><div class="section-content"><div class="guidance"><p><a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2018/FCA_2018_54.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2018/54 - 13/12/2018">1</a>The contents of this report are reflected in <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG 1</a></span></span> and <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG 2</a></span></span>.</p></div></div></div></section></div>

</p><p><strong>Business-wide risk assessments</strong>
</p><p>Intermediaries should identify and assess the bribery and corruption risk across all aspects of their business.
</p><p>Examples of factors which intermediaries should consider when assessing risk across their business.
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D24"><p>•	Risks associated with the jurisdictions the intermediary does business in, the sectors they do business with and how they generate business.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D25"><p>•	Risks associated with insurance distribution chains, in particular where these are long. This includes taking steps to understand the risk associated with parties that are not immediate relationships, where these can be identified.  Parties that are not immediate relationships may include, in addition to the insured and the insurer, entities such as introducers, sub-brokers, co-brokers, producing brokers, consultants, coverholders and agents.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D26"><p>•	Risks arising from non-trading elements of the business, including staff recruitment and remuneration, corporate hospitality and charitable donations.</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>Risk assessments and due diligence for individual relationships</strong>
</p><p>The risk-rating process for individual third-party introducer and client relationships, for example the producing broker, should build on the intermediary’s business-wide risk assessment.
</p><p>Examples of factors intermediaries may consider when assessing bribery and corruption risk associated with individual relationships include:
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D27"><p>•	the role that the party performs in the distribution chain</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D28"><p>•	the territory in which it is based or in which it does business</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D29"><p>•	how much and how the party is remunerated for this work</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D30"><p>•	the risk associated with the industry sector or class of business, and</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D31"><p>•	the governance and ownership of the third party, including any political or governmental connections.</p></li>
</ol><p>Intermediaries should decide on the level of due diligence, and which party to apply due diligence to, based on their assessment of risk associated with the relationship. This may include other parties in the insurance chain and not just their immediate contact. Where it is not possible or feasible to conduct due diligence on other parties, intermediaries should consider alternative approaches, such as adjustments to the level of monitoring to identify unusual or suspicious payments.
</p><p>Examples of the type of information which intermediaries may obtain as part of the due diligence process include:
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D32"><p>•	other intermediaries’ terms of business and identification documentation, including information about their anti-corruption controls</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D33"><p>•	checks, as risk dictates, on company directors, controllers and ultimate beneficial owners, considering any individuals or companies linked to the client, PEP screening and status, links to a PEP or national government, sanctions screening, adverse media screening and action taken in relation to any screening hits, and</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D34"><p>•	for third-party introducers, details of the business rationale.</p></li>

<a class="autodeftext" href="">FCTR</a> contains summaries of, and links to, thematic reviews of various financial crime risks. It includes the consolidated examples of good and poor practice that were included with the reviews’ findings. Each chapter includes a statement about those to whom it is most relevant and, where good and poor practice is included, to whom that guidance applies. We have suggested where material may be of interest and use to a broader range of firms, but we will only take guidance as applying to those types of firms to whom we have directly applied it. Each chapter also includes cross references to relevant chapters in <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCG</a>.</p>

There may be firms, particularly, <strong>smaller firms</strong>, that monitor credibly and effectively using manual procedures. This chapter will not apply to such firms where they do not, and are not intending to, use AML TM systems, although it may still be of interest to them.</p>

<li class="subpara1" id="D15"><p>•	Depending on the nature and scale of a firm’s business activities, automated AML TM systems may be an important component of an effective overall AML control environment.</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>Methodologies</strong></p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D16"><p>•	TM systems use profiling and/or rules-based monitoring methods.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D17"><p>•	Profiling identifies unusual patterns of customer activity by applying statistical modelling techniques. These compare current patterns of activity to historical activity for that customer or peer group.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D18"><p>•	Rules-based monitoring compares customer activity to fixed pre-set thresholds or patterns to determine if it is unusual.</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>Development and implementation</strong></p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D19"><p>•	A clear understanding of what the system will deliver and what constraints will be imposed by the limitations of the available data (including any issues arising from data cleanliness or legacy systems).</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D20"><p>•	Consideration of whether the vendor has the skills, resources and ability to deliver the promised service and provide adequate ongoing support.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D21"><p>•	Maintenance of good working relations with the vendor, e.g. when collaborating to agree detailed system configuration.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D22"><p>•	Use of recommended hardware, not necessarily a firm’s own standard, to reduce processing problems, or otherwise finding a solution that is a good fit with a firm’s existing infrastructure.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D23"><p>•	A full understanding of the data being entered into the system and of the business’s requirements.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D24"><p>•	Regular housekeeping and database maintenance (operational resilience is vital to ensure that queries do not back up).</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D25"><p>•	Careful consideration of the risks of commissioning a bespoke vendor system, which may be incompatible with future standard product upgrades.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D26"><p>•	Continued allocation of sufficient resources to ensure manual internal suspicion reporting is effective, as TM can supplement, but not replace, human awareness in day-to-day business.</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>Effectiveness</strong></p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D27"><p>•	Analyse system performance at a sufficiently detailed level, for example on a rule-by-rule basis, to understand the real underlying drivers of the performance results.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D28"><p>•	Set systems so they do not generate fewer alerts simply to improve performance statistics. There is a risk of ‘artificially’ increasing the proportion of alerts that are ultimately reported as suspicious activity reports without generating an improvement in the quality and quantity of the alerts being generated.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D29"><p>•	Deploy analytical tools to identify suspicious activity that is currently not being flagged by existing rules or profile-based monitoring.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D30"><p>•	Allocate adequate resources to analysing and assessing system performance, in particular to define how success is measured and produce robust objective data to analyse performance against these measures.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D31"><p>•	Consistently monitor from one period to another, rather than on an intermittent basis, to ensure that performance data is not distorted by, for example, ad hoc decisions to run particular rules at different times.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D32"><p>•	Measure performance as far as possible against like-for-like comparators, e.g. peers operating in similar markets and using similar profiling and rules.</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>Oversight</strong></p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D33"><p>•	Senior management should be in a position to monitor the performance of TM systems, particularly at firms that are experiencing operational or performance issues with their systems, so that issues are resolved in a timely fashion.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D34"><p>•	Close involvement of the project management process by major business unit stakeholders and IT departments is an important component of successful system implementation.</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>Reporting &amp; review</strong></p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D35"><p>•	There should be a clear allocation of responsibilities for reviewing, investigating and reporting details of alerts generated by TM systems. Those responsible for this work should have appropriate levels of skill and be subject to effective operational control and quality assurance processes.</p></li>

<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>One large firm’s procedures required it to undertake periodic Know Your Customer (KYC)/Customer Due Diligence (CDD) reviews of existing clients. The depth of the review is determined by the risk ranking assigned to the client. Clients rated A and B are reviewed every three years; Cs every two years; and Ds and Es are reviewed annually. For lower risk (A-C) clients, the review may amount to no more than refreshing the client’s file to take account of: significant changes in ownership or capitalisation; changes in the client’s line of business; addition of a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) to shareholders or senior management; or any negative news on the client’s owners or senior managers. For high risk (D or E) clients, visits to the client are necessary to provide an extra layer of comfort. Such visits would typically cover: review of client’s client take-on procedures; sample testing of KYC documentation on underlying clients; and, obtaining answers to outstanding queries on, e.g., annual AML certification, transaction queries, and potential PEP or sanctions hits.</p></td>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>•</p></td>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>Some firms did not have a robust approach to classifying the money laundering risk associated with their clients. For example, one wholesale small firm classified all its clients as low or medium risk, despite the fact that most of them were based in Eastern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Another firm’s risk-assessment procedures provided that the Compliance Officer or MLRO (Money Laundering Reporting Officer. See <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG Annex 1</a></span></span> for common terms) would determine the risk category for each client and would record the basis of the assessment for each client. However, a file review showed no evidence that risk assessments had actually been carried out.</p></td>

<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>•</p></td>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>One building society undertook a comprehensive policy review following the publication of the 2006 JMLSG (Joint Money Laundering Steering Group. See <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG Annex 1</a></span></span> for common terms) guidance, in order to identify which parts of the business were affected and what action was needed. It identified eight core business areas, which represented the key operational areas exposed to risk from money laundering. These business areas were ranked in order of risk and formed into workstreams. The local managers from each workstream business area were then trained by the Compliance Policy Team, using a series of presentations and individual workshops, to understand the impact of the risk-based approach, their individual responsibilities and the appropriate customer due diligence policies. These managers were then required to apply this awareness and their existing knowledge of their workstreams’ business activities to create documented risk profiles covering customers, products, delivery channels and geography. The risk profiles were graded as Red, Amber and Green and customer due diligence and monitoring requirements set at appropriate levels.</p></td>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>•</p></td>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>Some small firms had produced inadequate annual MLRO reports, which failed to demonstrate to their governing body and senior management that the firms’ AML systems and controls were operating effectively. In one case, the MLRO stated categorically that there had been no perceived deficiencies in the suspicious activity reporting process. However, he was unable even to describe that process to us, so it was highly unlikely that he had ever reviewed the SAR (Suspicious Activity Report. See <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG Annex 1</a></span></span> for common terms) process for possible deficiencies.</p></td>

<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>•</p></td>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>In response to the <a class="autodeftext" href="">SYSC</a> changes, one major bank decided to appoint the MLRO’s line manager as the designated director with overarching responsibility for AML controls. This director was seen as the obvious choice for the role, given that his portfolio of responsibilities included fraud, risk and money laundering. The bank’s decision formally to appoint a Board-level senior manager to this position was viewed as reinforcing the importance of having in place a robust AML control framework. Following his appointment, the director decided that the management information (MI) on AML issues he had hitherto received was too ad hoc and fragmented. So the <a class="autodeftext" href="">SYSC</a>/JMLSG changes proved to be a catalyst for the bank establishing more organised MI and a Group-level Financial Risk Committee to consider relevant issues. (In the past, various Risk Committees had considered such issues.) The new Committee’s remit covered fraud, money laundering and sanctions issues; however, its primary focus was AML.</p></td>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>•</p></td>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>In one small firm, the MLRO was clearly not fully engaged in his role. For example, he was unaware that we had removed the Money Laundering sourcebook and he was still using an outdated (2003) edition of the JMLSG Guidance. It was not entirely clear whether this arose from a lack of interest in his MLRO function or from inadequate compliance resources at the firm, which left him with insufficient time to keep up to date with AML matters, or a combination of both.</p></td>

<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>One large bank judged that staff AML training and awareness were suitable for the development of a risk-based approach. It saw a need to differentiate between AML requirements in various business units, so that training could be adapted to the needs of the job. So in Retail, training had been re-designed to produce a more balanced package. Accordingly, staff were required to undertake one training module per quarter, with the emphasis on a different area in each module and a test taken every quarter. The aim was to see what impact this constant ‘drip feed’ of training had on suspicious activity reporting. At the time of the <a class="autodeftext" href="">FSA’s</a> visit, this bank was also in the throes of merging its anti- fraud and AML training. The overall objective was to make it more difficult for criminals to do business with the bank undetected.</p></td>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>•</p></td>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p>We found some cases of medium-sized and smaller firms documenting their client take-on procedures but not regularly updating those procedures and not always following them. For example, one firm told us that CDD information on clients was refreshed every time clients applied for a new product or service. However, a file review showed no evidence that this had been done.</p></td>

One firm told us that training was delivered as part of an induction programme but not refreshed at regular intervals throughout the employee’s career. Another firm said that it provided AML induction training only if a new joiner specifically requested it and no new employee had actually made such a request. The firm’s MLRO took the view that most new employees came from the regulated sector, so should already be aware of their AML obligations. Such employees were merely required to sign a form to confirm that they were aware of the firm’s AML procedures, but their understanding was never tested.</p></td>

<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2018/FCA_2018_54.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2018/54 - 13/12/2018">1</a>In April 2008 the <a class="autodeftext" href="">FSA</a> published the findings of our thematic review on how financial services firms in the UK were addressing the risk that customer data may be lost or stolen and used to commit fraud or other financial crime. The <a class="autodeftext" href="">FSA</a> visited 39 firms, including retail and wholesale banks, investment firms, insurance companies, financial advisers and credit unions. The <a class="autodeftext" href="">FSA</a> also took into account our experience of data loss incidents dealt with by our Financial Crime Operations Team: during 2007, the team dealt with 56 cases of lost or stolen data from financial services firms.</p>

The <a class="autodeftext" href="">FSA</a> found that firms lacked a clear understanding of these risks and were therefore failing properly to inform customers, resulting in a lack of transparency.</p>

<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2018/FCA_2018_54.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2018/54 - 13/12/2018">1</a>The review emphasised the importance of appropriate vetting and training of all staff, particularly with regard to local staff who had financial crime responsibilities. An examination revealed that training in this area was often lacking and not reflective of the needs of, and work done by, members of staff. The report emphasised that senior management should ensure that staff operating in these roles were given proper financial crime training as well as ensuring they possessed the appropriate technical know-how. The review also highlighted that, due to high staff turnover, firms needed appropriate and thorough vetting controls to supplement inadequate local electronic intelligence and search systems.</p>
