<tr>
<td class="entry text-align-center" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Values</strong></p><p> 
Co-operatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity. In the tradition of their founders, co-operative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others. 
</p><p><strong>Principles</strong></p><p>The co-operative principles are guidelines by which co-operatives put their values into practice.</p><p><strong>1. Voluntary and open membership</strong></p><p> 
Co-operatives are voluntary organisations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination. 
</p><p><strong>2. Democratic member control</strong></p><p> 
Co-operatives are democratic organisations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner. </p><p><strong>3. Member economic participation</strong></p><p> 
Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.</p><p><strong> 
4. Autonomy and independence</strong></p><p> 
Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organisations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organisations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy. 
</p><p><strong>5. Education, training and information</strong></p><p>
Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.</p><p>
<strong>6. Co-operation among co-operatives</strong></p><p>
Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.
</p><p><strong>7. Concern for community</strong></p><p>
Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.

For instance, we know that the relationship between members (as co-owners and users of the co-operative) and their co-operative is different in a consumer co-operative from a worker co-operative or a producer co-operative. Likewise the relationship between members and their society may differ between primary co-operatives (where members are individuals), secondary co-operatives (where members are primary co-operatives), and tertiary co-operatives (where members are secondary co-operatives). Similarly a co-operative made up of a single group of stakeholders will have different relationships from a co-operative with multiple stakeholder groups as members.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="level guidance" id="D26"><div class="details"><span class="extended" id="D26">RFCCBS 4.3.7</span><span class="section-type guidance" title="Guidance">G</span><time><span>24/02/2023</span></time></div><div class="section-content"><div class="guidance"><p><a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2023/FCA_2023_6.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2023/6 - 24/02/2023">1</a>This guidance is not exhaustive.

<p>
A community benefit society must be carrying on an ‘industry, business or trade’. That business industry or trade must be ‘being, or intended to be, conducted for the benefit of the community’. This is the condition for registration.</p>
<p>
The Act does not define the words ‘community benefit’. Below we explain our approach to applying these words. At the end of this chapter we provide further guidance on subsidiaries.</p>

<p>
A community benefit society must be carrying on an ‘industry, business or trade’. That business industry or trade must be ‘being, or intended to be, conducted for the benefit of the community’. This is the condition for registration.</p>
<p>
The Act does not define the words ‘community benefit’. Below we explain our approach to applying these words. At the end of this chapter we provide further guidance on subsidiaries.</p>

<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2023/FCA_2023_6.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2023/6 - 24/02/2023">1</a>Generally co-operative societies offer membership to people who can use their services (whether as workers, producers or consumers). However, a co-operative society may sometimes need to raise capital from people who cannot or do not use the society’s services. We describe these members as ‘non-user investor members’ – people who have only an investment relationship with the society.</p>

<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2023/FCA_2023_6.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2023/6 - 24/02/2023">1</a>While offering membership to non-user investor members gives a co-operative society access to capital, it also brings risks to its ability to comply with its condition for registration. The way capital is accessed must not compromise the society’s compliance with the condition for registration. The following factors are indicators that the society is complying with its condition for registration as a bona fide co-operative society:</p>
<ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D83">(1) <p>The rules of a society which wants to raise capital from non-user investor members expressly provide for non-user investor shares, and the terms attached to these shares are clearly stated.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D84">(2) <p>The voting rights of non-user investor shareholders are restricted by the rules of the society. The society’s rules prevent this category of shareholders voting on a motion to convert the co-operative to a company. Societies can, however, include a power to elect one or more non-user investor share representatives to the board.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D85">(3) <p>Ultimate control of the society remains with members other than non-user investor members at all times. Non-user investor members do not together have voting rights that when combined would result in user-members losing control of the society.</p></li>

<li class="subpara1" id="D83">(1) <p>The rules of a society which wants to raise capital from non-user investor members expressly provide for non-user investor shares, and the terms attached to these shares are clearly stated.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D84">(2) <p>The voting rights of non-user investor shareholders are restricted by the rules of the society.

<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2023/FCA_2023_6.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2023/6 - 24/02/2023">1</a>A society can pass a special resolution to transfer its engagements to any other society or company that agrees to fulfil them. The decision to transfer engagements to another society or company must be made in accordance with the society’s rules. For instance, a community benefit society with an asset lock cannot transfer its engagements to an entity without a statutory asset lock. The resolution can also transfer all or part of the society’s property to the society or company receiving the engagements without any other legal process such as a conveyance. Transferring engagements does not prejudice any right of a creditor of either of the societies or companies involved.</p>

However, if it has transferred both its engagements and all its property, it usually applies to cancel its registration. The society can only be deregistered after it has filed a certificate under section 126 of the Act with us. This confirms that all the society’s property has been transferred to those entitled to it.</p>

For instance, we would generally treat ‘co-op’, ‘co-operatives’ and ‘coop’ in the same way as ‘co-operative’.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="level guidance" id="D31"><div class="details"><span id="D31">RFCCBS App 1.1.1</span><time><span>24/02/2023</span></time></div><div class="section-content-table"><div class="guidance"><table class="table"><tbody class="tbody">
