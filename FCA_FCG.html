<a class="autodeftext" href="">FCG</a> is not a standalone document; it does not attempt to set out all applicable requirements and should be read in conjunction with existing laws, rules and guidance on financial crime. If there is a discrepancy between <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCG</a> and any applicable legal requirements, the provisions of the relevant requirement prevail. If firms have any doubt about a legal or other provision or their responsibilities under <a class="external-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/2018-12-13" target="_blank">FSMA</a> or other relevant legislation or requirements, they should seek appropriate professional advice.</p>
<p>Among other requirements, firms should consider whether their financial crime systems and controls are consistent, where applicable, with their Consumer Duty obligations.<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">2</a></p>
<p>For instance, in complying with the Consumer Duty, firms may consider additional steps in their customer journeys to help prevent financial crime, including fraud. They may also consider offering additional consumer support, such as:<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">2</a></p>

<p>Firms should consider FG22/5 when applying their financial crime systems and controls. In particular, firms may find it helpful to consider the following provisions:<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">2</a></p>

For example:</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D30"><p>•	We say in <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG 2.2.1G</a></span></span> (Governance) that senior management should actively engage in a firm’s approach to addressing financial crime risk. The level of seniority and degree of engagement that is appropriate will differ based on a variety of factors, including the management structure of the firm and the seriousness of the risk.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D31"><p>•	We ask in <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG 3.2.5G</a></span></span> (Ongoing monitoring) how a firm monitors transactions to spot potential money laundering. While we expect that a global retail bank that carries out a large number of customer transactions would need to include automated systems in its processes if it is to monitor effectively, a small firm with low transaction volumes could do so manually.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D32"><p>•	We say in <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG 4.2.1G</a></span></span> (General – preventing losses from fraud) that it is good practice for firms to engage with relevant cross-industry efforts to combat fraud. A national retail bank is likely to have a greater exposure to fraud, and therefore to have more information to contribute to such efforts, than a small local building society, and we would expect this to be reflected in their levels of engagement.</p></li>

<a class="autodeftext" href="">FCG</a> is not a standalone document; it does not attempt to set out all applicable requirements and should be read in conjunction with existing laws, rules and guidance on financial crime. If there is a discrepancy between <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCG</a> and any applicable legal requirements, the provisions of the relevant requirement prevail. If firms have any doubt about a legal or other provision or their responsibilities under <a class="external-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/2018-12-13" target="_blank">FSMA</a> or other relevant legislation or requirements, they should seek appropriate professional advice.</p>
<p>Among other requirements, firms should consider whether their financial crime systems and controls are consistent, where applicable, with their Consumer Duty obligations.<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">2</a></p>
<p>For instance, in complying with the Consumer Duty, firms may consider additional steps in their customer journeys to help prevent financial crime, including fraud. They may also consider offering additional consumer support, such as:<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">2</a></p>

<p>Firms should consider FG22/5 when applying their financial crime systems and controls. In particular, firms may find it helpful to consider the following provisions:<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">2</a></p>

A firm should identify and assess the financial crime risks to which it is exposed as a result of, for example, the products and services it offers, the jurisdictions it operates in, the types of customer it attracts, the complexity and volume of transactions, and the distribution channels it uses to service its customers. Firms can then target their financial crime resources on the areas of greatest risk.
</p><p>A <strong>business-wide risk assessment</strong> – or risk assessments – should:
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D30"><p>•	be comprehensive and consider a wide range of factors – it is not normally enough to consider just one factor
</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D31"><p>•	draw on a wide range of relevant information – it is not normally enough to consider just one source, and
</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D32"><p>•	be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the firm’s activities.
</p></li>
</ol><p>	Firms should build on their business-wide risk assessment or risk assessments to determine the level of risk associated with <strong>individual relationships</strong>. This should:</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D33"><p>•	enable the firm to take a holistic view of the risk associated with the relationship, considering all relevant risk factors, and</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D34"><p>
•	enable the firm to apply the appropriate level of due diligence to manage the risks identified.
</p></li>
</ol><p>	The assessment of risk associated with individual relationships can inform, but is not a substitute for, business-wide risk assessments.</p><p>
Firms should regularly review both their business-wide and individual risk assessments to ensure they remain current.</p><p>
	Self-assessment questions:
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D41"><p>•	What are the main financial crime <strong>risks</strong> to the business?</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D35"><p>•	How does your firm seek to <strong>understand</strong> the financial crime risks it faces?

</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D38"><p>•	Is there evidence that risk is considered and recorded systematically, assessments are updated and <strong>sign-off</strong> is appropriate?
</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D39"><p>•	Who <strong>challenges</strong> risk assessments and how? Is this process sufficiently rigorous and well-documented?

Regulation 21(1)(a) of the <a class="autodeftext" href="">Money Laundering Regulations</a> requires that where appropriate with regard to the size and nature of its business, <a class="autodeftext" href="">firms</a> subject to the regulations must appoint one individual who is a member of its board of directors (or if there is no board, of its equivalent <a class="autodeftext" href="">management body</a>) or of its <a class="autodeftext" href="">senior management</a> as the officer responsible for compliance with the regulations. Regulation 21(3) also requires the appointment of a nominated officer. Regulation 21(4) requires a <a class="autodeftext" href="">firm</a> to inform their supervisory authority of the identity of the individual appointed (including any subsequent appointments) within 14 <a class="autodeftext" href="">days</a> of such appointment. 

</p><p>As <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">SYSC 6.3.9R</a></span></span> and <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">SYSC 3.2.6IR</a></span></span> also require firms subject to those provisions to have an MLRO, the <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCA</a> expects that this individual can be the same individual appointed under Regulation 21(1)(a) and/or 21(3) of the <a class="autodeftext" href="">Money Laundering Regulations</a> and so <a class="autodeftext" href="">firms</a> do not need to make a separate notification to the FCA.

It is a requirement where the customer is a PEP.</p><p><strong>
‘Source of wealth’</strong> describes how a customer or beneficial owner acquired their total wealth.</p><p><strong>
‘Source of funds’</strong> refers to the origin of the funds involved in the business relationship or occasional transaction. It refers to the activity that generated the funds, for example salary payments or sale proceeds, as well as the means through which the customer’s or beneficial owner’s funds were transferred.
</p><p>The JMLSG’s guidance provides that, in situations where the risk of money laundering/terrorist financing is very low and subject to certain conditions, firms may assume that a payment drawn on an account in the customer’s name with a UK, EU or equivalent regulated credit institution satisfied the standard CDD requirements. This is sometimes referred to as ‘source of funds as evidence’ and is distinct from ‘source of funds’ in the context of Regulation  28(11) and Regulations 33 and 35 of the <a class="autodeftext" href="">Money Laundering Regulations</a> and of <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCG</a>. Nothing in <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCG</a> prevents the use of ‘source of funds as evidence’ in situations where this is appropriate.
</p><p>Where the customer is either a PEP,  a family member of a PEP or known close associate of a PEP,  a firm may have regard to guidance issued by the <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCA</a> on the treatment of PEPs. </p><p>[<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> see <a class="external-link" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/finalised-guidance/fg17-6-treatment-politically-exposed-persons-peps-money-laundering" target="_blank">https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/finalised-guidance/fg17-6-treatment-politically-exposed-persons-peps-money-laundering</a>.]</p></div></div></div></section><section><header><h2 class="crosstitle">Handling higher risk situations</h2></header></section><section><div class="level guidance" id="D39"><div class="details"><span class="extended" id="D39">FCG 3.2.7</span><span class="section-type guidance"></span><time><span>29/11/2024</span></time></div><div class="section-content"><div class="guidance"><p><a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2018/FCA_2018_54.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2018/54 - 13/12/2018">1</a>The law requires that firms’ anti-money laundering policies and procedures are sensitive to risks. This means that in higher risk situations, firms must apply enhanced due diligence and ongoing monitoring. <strong>Situations that present a higher money laundering risk</strong> might include, but are not restricted to: customers linked to higher risk countries or business sectors; or who have unnecessarily complex or opaque beneficial ownership structures; and transactions which are unusual, lack an obvious economic or lawful purpose, are complex or large or might lend themselves to anonymity.
</p><p>Firms must take account of risk factors set out under regulation 33(6) which relate to customer risk, product risk and geographical risk when assessing whether there is a high risk of money laundering or terrorist financing in a particular situation and the extent of measures which should be taken to manage and mitigate that risk.<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2020/FCA_2020_45.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2020/45 - 01/10/2020">2</a></p><p><strong>The </strong> <a class="autodeftext" href="">Money Laundering Regulations</a> <strong>also set out some scenarios in which specific enhanced due diligence measures have to be applied:
</strong></p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D41"><p>•	<strong>Correspondent relationships</strong>: where a correspondent credit institution or financial institution, involving the execution of payment, is from a third country (see regulation 34 of the <a class="autodeftext" href="">Money Laundering Regulations</a>), the UK credit or financial institution should apply both EDD measures in regulation 33 as well as additional measures outlined in regulation 34<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">3</a> commensurate to the risk of the relationship. This can include in higher risk situations thoroughly understanding its correspondent’s business, reputation, and the quality of its defences against money laundering and terrorist financing. Senior management must also give approval before establishing a new correspondent relationship. JMLSG guidance sets out how firms should apply EDD in differing correspondent trading relationships.
</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D42"><p>•	<strong>Politically exposed persons (PEPs), family members and known close associates of a PEP</strong>: a PEP is a person entrusted with a prominent public function, other than as a middle-ranking or more junior official. PEPs (as well as their family members and known close associates) must be subject to enhanced scrutiny. A senior manager at an appropriate level of authority must also approve the initiation of a business relationship with a PEP (or with a family member, or known close associate, of a PEP). This includes approving a relationship continuing with an existing customer who became a PEP after the relationship begun.  In meeting these obligations firms may have regard to the <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCA’s</a> guidance on a risk-based approach to PEPs.

EDD should give firms a <strong>greater understanding</strong> of the customer and their associated risk than standard due diligence.

Interbank payments can be abused by criminals. International policymakers have taken steps intended to increase the transparency of interbank payments, allowing law enforcement agencies to more easily trace payments related to, for example, drug trafficking or terrorism. The <a class="autodeftext" href="">Money Laundering Regulations</a> require<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">3</a> banks to collect and attach information about payers and payees of wire transfers (such as names and addresses<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">3</a>) to payment messages. Banks are also required to check this information is present on inbound payments, and chase missing data. The <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCA</a> has a legal responsibility to supervise banks’ compliance with these requirements. Concerns have also been raised about interbank transfers known as “cover payments” (see <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG Annex 1</a></span></span>) that can be abused to disguise funds’ origins. To address these concerns, the SWIFT payment messaging system now allows originator and beneficiary information to accompany these payments.
</p><p>From 1 September 2023, similar obligations have applied for cryptoasset transfers undertaken by cryptoasset businesses registered with the <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCA</a> under the <a class="autodeftext" href="">Money Laundering Regulations</a>.

In January 2009, Lloyds TSB agreed to pay US$350m to US authorities after Lloyds offices in Britain and Dubai were discovered to be deliberately removing customer names and addresses from US wire transfers connected to countries or persons on US sanctions lists. The US Department of Justice concluded that Lloyds TSB staff removed this information to ensure payments would pass undetected through automatic filters at American financial institutions. See its press release: www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/January/09-crm-023.html.</p><p>
In August 2010, Barclays Bank PLC agreed to pay US$298m to US authorities after it was found to have implemented practices designed to evade US sanctions for the benefit of sanctioned countries and persons, including by stripping information from payment messages that would have alerted US financial institutions about the true origins of the funds. The bank self-reported the breaches, which took place over a decade-long period from as early as the mid-1990s to September 2006. See the US Department of Justice’s press release: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/August/10-crm-933.html" target="_blank">www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/August/10-crm-933.html</a>.

Ultimately, they build up enough information to pose successfully as their victim.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D13"><p>2. ‘<strong>Only individuals with a high net worth are attractive targets for identity fraudsters.</strong>’ In fact, people of all ages, in all occupations and in all income groups are vulnerable if their data is lost.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D14"><p>3. ‘<strong>Only large firms with millions of customers are likely to be targeted.</strong>’ Wrong. Even a small firm’s customer database might be sold and re-sold for a substantial sum.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D15"><p>4. ‘<strong>The threat to data security is external.</strong>’ This is not always the case. Insiders have more opportunity to steal customer data and may do so either to commit fraud themselves, or to pass it on to organised criminals.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D16"><p>5. ‘<strong>No customer has ever notified us that their identity has been stolen, so our firm must be impervious to data breaches.</strong>’ The truth may be closer to the opposite: firms that successfully detect data loss do so because they have effective risk-management systems. Firms with weak controls or monitoring are likely to be oblivious to any loss. Furthermore, when fraud does occur, a victim rarely has the means to identify where their data was lost because data is held in so many places.</p></li>

The Act introduces a new offence for commercial organisations of failing to prevent bribery. It is a defence for firms charged with this offence to show that they had adequate bribery-prevention procedures in place.

HM Government publishes the UK Sanctions List, which provides details of those designated under regulations made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act. The list also details which sanctions measures apply to these persons or ships. OFSI <a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">2</a> maintains a Consolidated List of financial sanctions targets designated by the United Nations  and the United Kingdom, which is available from its website. If firms become aware of a breach, they must notify OFSI in accordance with the relevant provisions. OFSI have published guidance on complying with UK obligations and this is available on their website. See <a class="external-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs</a>.</p>

<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">2</a>Firms should also consider whether they should report sanctions breaches to the <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCA</a>. <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">SUP 15.3</a></span></span> contains general notification requirements. Firms are required to tell us, for example, about significant rule breaches (see <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">SUP 15.3.11R(1)</a></span></span>). Firms should therefore consider whether a sanctions breach is the result of any matter within the scope of <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">SUP 15.3</a></span></span> – for example, a significant failure in their financial crime systems and controls.</p>

<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2018/FCA_2018_54.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2018/54 - 13/12/2018">1</a>The Office of Financial Sanctions (OFSI) within the Treasury helps to ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced in the United Kingdom. HM Government publishes the UK Sanctions List, which provides details of those designated under regulations made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act. The list also details which sanctions measures apply to these persons or ships. OFSI <a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">2</a> maintains a Consolidated List of financial sanctions targets designated by the United Nations  and the United Kingdom, which is available from its website. If firms become aware of a breach, they must notify OFSI in accordance with the relevant provisions. OFSI have published guidance on complying with UK obligations and this is available on their website. See <a class="external-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs</a>.</p>

<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2024/FCA_2024_46.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2024/46 - 29/11/2024">2</a>Firms should also consider whether they should report sanctions breaches to the <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCA</a>. <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">SUP 15.3</a></span></span> contains general notification requirements. Firms are required to tell us, for example, about significant rule breaches (see <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">SUP 15.3.11R(1)</a></span></span>). Firms should therefore consider whether a sanctions breach is the result of any matter within the scope of <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">SUP 15.3</a></span></span> – for example, a significant failure in their financial crime systems and controls.</p>

As part of this, the export of goods and services for use in nuclear, radiological, chemical or biological weapons programmes is subject to strict controls. Proliferators seek to gain access to this technology illegally: aiding them is an offence under the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2001/24/2018-12-13" target="_blank">Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001</a>. Note that the Treasury can also use powers under the Counter Terrorism Act 2008 (see <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG  Annex 1</a></span></span>) to direct financial firms to, say, cease business with certain customers involved in proliferation activity.</p>

Firms’ policies and procedures should include steps designed to counter the risk of insider dealing and market manipulation occurring through the firm. Policies and procedures should be aligned and make reference to the firm’s insider dealing and market manipulation risk assessment.
</p><p>Firms should ensure that their policies and procedures cover both:
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D44">(1) <p>identifying and taking steps to counter the risk of financial crime before any trade is executed, and</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D45">(2) <p>mitigating future risks posed by clients or employees who have already been identified as having traded suspiciously.</p></li>
</ol><p>Firms should make sure that front office employees are aware of the firm’s policies and procedures with regard to countering the risk that the firm is used to further financial crime. Among other things, these should reflect the <a class="autodeftext" href="">FCA’s</a> expectation that market participants do not knowingly or intentionally aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of a criminal offence (insider dealing or market manipulation). Therefore, where the firm holds information which leads to the conclusion that its employee or client is seeking to trade either manipulatively or on the basis of inside information, it should refuse to execute the trade where it is able to do so.</p><p>Firms’ policies and procedures should state clearly how they identify and monitor employees’ trading, in addition to their clients’ trading. <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">COBS 11.7</a></span></span> requires firms that conduct designated investment business to have a personal account dealing (PAD) policy. Appropriately designed PAD policies can:</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D46"><p>•	counter the risk that employees of the firm commit financial crime themselves,</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D47"><p>
•	make sure that conflicts of interest that might result in employees not escalating suspicious activity are avoided. For example, if employees are allowed to copy clients’ trades on their own accounts, they may be less inclined to escalate financial crime concerns that only become apparent post-trade, as, by reporting the client they would, by implication, be reporting their own trading as suspicious.
</p></li>
</ol><p>Policies and procedures relevant to each business area, including front office functions, should be communicated and embedded.
</p><p>Self-assessment questions:
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D48"><p>•	Does the policy define how the firm will counter the risk of being used to facilitate insider dealing and market manipulation? For example, in what circumstances would the firm conduct enhanced monitoring or stop providing trading access to a particular client or employee?
</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D49"><p>•	Does the firm have established procedures for following up and reviewing possibly suspicious behaviour?
</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D50"><p>•	Do front office staff understand how insider dealing and market manipulation might be committed through the firm, to escalate potentially suspicious activity when appropriate, and challenge client or employee orders (where relevant), if they believe the activity will amount to financial crime? Does the firm have effective whistleblowing arrangements in place to support appropriate financial crime detection and reporting?

It may be appropriate to use the results of this monitoring for the purpose of countering financial crime.
</p><p>Firms should note that the markets and instruments to which the criminal offences of insider dealing and market manipulation apply are different to those covered by the <a class="autodeftext" href="">Market Abuse Regulation</a>. Firms should therefore assess whether their arrangements to detect and report market abuse can be appropriately relied on to monitor for potential insider dealing and market manipulation.
</p><p>For their risk assessments, firms should regularly take steps to consider whether their employees and/or clients may be conducting insider dealing or market manipulation. This could be achieved by transaction, order and communications surveillance, with consideration given to the employee’s or client’s usual trading behaviour and/or strategies, and in respect of clients: initial on-boarding checks and ongoing due diligence, or other methods. 
</p><p>Firms should consider the risks that arise in scenarios whereby their client is not the decision maker behind the activity taking place, with orders and trades being instructed by an underlying client. In this scenario, where a firm is concerned either about a particular client or trade, firms should consider the steps they could take to gain further information, or an understanding, of the client, underlying client and/or activity. The firm may wish to engage with its client to obtain further information about the trading in question and/or the nature of the underlying client(s).</p><p> 
If a firm is, based on their understanding of a client and monitoring of that client’s transactions, suspicious that a client might have committed or attempted to commit insider dealing or market manipulation, the firm should comply with its obligations to report those suspicions via a STOR and/or SAR (where appropriate). In addition, it may be appropriate for the firm to document the options available to it to counter the risk of any ongoing financial crime posed by its ongoing relationship with that client, and when these options should be considered.</p><p>In addition, a firm must also submit a STOR where it identifies suspicious trading by an employee. The nominated officer of the firm would also be required to report any knowledge or suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing arising from trade by submitting a SAR to the NCA. Again, the firm’s policies and procedures should document the options available to it to counter the risk of any ongoing financial crime related to employee trading activity, and when these options should be considered. 
</p><p>Options available to firms to counter the risk of being used to further financial crime by its clients and/or employees could include:
</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D52"><p>•	Carrying out enhanced due diligence on a client and enhanced monitoring of a client’s or employee’s trading activity.
</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D66"><p>
•	Restricting the client’s access to particular markets or instruments.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D53"><p>•	Restricting services provided to the client (eg direct market access).
</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D54"><p>•	Restricting the amount of leverage the firm is willing to provide to the client.

</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D67"><p>•	Taking disciplinary action against an employee.</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D56"><p>•	Ultimately terminating the client or employee relationship. The appropriate response will depend on the outcome of the firm’s monitoring procedures and the extent and nature of any suspicious activity identified.
</p></li>
</ol><p>Self-assessment questions:</p><ol>
<li class="subpara1" id="D57"><p>•	Does the firm consider its obligations to counter financial crime when a client’s or employee’s activity is determined as suspicious via surveillance systems and subsequent investigation?
</p></li>
<li class="subpara1" id="D58"><p>•	How do the firm’s monitoring arrangements interact with the client-on-boarding process / AML framework?

As such, firms may find it simpler to consider this guidance as applying to all instruments to which both the <a class="autodeftext" href="">Market Abuse Regulation</a> and the criminal regimes set out in <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">FCG 8.1.2G</a></span></span> apply.

<a class="changed-by" href="/instrument/2018/FCA_2018_54.pdf" target="_blank" title="FCA 2018/54 - 13/12/2018">1</a>To commit insider dealing, as well as certain forms of market manipulation, the perpetrator must typically engage with, or work within, a firm able to access the relevant financial markets on their behalf. It is critical that firms that offer access to relevant financial markets have adequate policies and procedures to counter the risk that the firm might be used to further financial crime, in accordance with <span class="xref"><span class="xrefout"><a href="">SYSC 6.1.1R</a></span></span>.</p>
<p>
<a class="autodeftext" href="">FCG</a> is not intended to be prescriptive to every business model type. It is incumbent upon a firm to ensure that its policies, procedures and risk framework are tailored and appropriate to the nature of its business, eg client type(s), product type(s), means of order transmission and execution, risks posed by employees, etc.

<p>
•	Market operators and investment firms that operate a trading venue to establish and maintain effective arrangements, systems and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing insider dealing, market manipulation and attempted insider dealing and market manipulation.

The directions can require enhanced due diligence and ongoing monitoring, the systematic reporting of transactions, or the cessation of business. This offers the government flexibility that was not available in the traditional financial sanctions regime. We are responsible for monitoring authorised firms’ and certain financial institutions’ compliance with these directions.</p>

<p>Where payments between customers of two banks in different countries and currencies require settlement by means of matching inter-bank payments, those matching payments are known as ‘cover payments’.

<p>Share scams are often run from ‘boiler rooms’ where fraudsters cold-call investors offering them often worthless, overpriced or even non-existent shares. While they promise high returns, those who invest usually end up losing their money. We have found victims of boiler rooms lose an average of £20,000 to these scams, with as much as £200m lost in the UK each year. Even seasoned investors have been caught out, with the biggest individual loss recorded by the police being £6m.

We have found victims of boiler rooms lose an average of £20,000 to these scams, with as much as £200m lost in the UK each year. Even seasoned investors have been caught out, with the biggest individual loss recorded by the police being £6m. We receive almost 5,000 calls each year from people who think they are victims of boiler room fraud.

<p>Regulation 37 of the <a class="autodeftext" href="">Money Laundering Regulations</a> allows firms, where they assess that a business relationship or transaction presents a low degree of risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. This regulation sets out a series of factors firms should consider when determining this risk. 
</p>
<p>SDD does not exempt firms from applying CDD measures but permits them to adjust the extent, timing or type of the measures it undertakes to reflect the lower risk it has assessed. A firm is required to carry out sufficient monitoring of any business relationships or transactions which are subject to those measures to enable it to detect any unusual or suspicious transactions.

<p>A formal legal definition of ‘trust or company service provider’ is given in Regulation 12(2) of the <a class="autodeftext" href="">Money Laundering Regulations</a>. A simple definition might be ‘an enterprise whose business creates, or enables the creation of, trusts and companies on behalf of others for a fee’. International standard setters have judged that such services can be abused by those seeking to set up corporate entities designed to disguise the true origins of illicit funds.
</p>
<p>The firms we authorise must inform us if they provide trust or company services.
